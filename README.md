# Data Analyst Internship â€“ Medical Appointment No Shows

This project is part of my internship task. The dataset comes from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/joniarroba/noshowappointments) and contains information about medical appointments in Brazil, including whether patients showed up or not.
